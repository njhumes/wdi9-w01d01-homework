/*  1.   Concatenation - 2 strings added together to equal a value
        Interpolation - put variables in between our strings

    2.  DRY - stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. As in don't write the same code twice
    3.  Declaring a variable is the first time the variable is used in the program
        therefore, we need to use const or let to define it.
        We could assing a value to an existing variable if it has already been declared
    4.  We use const when we know that the variable won't ever change. We use let to define any variable that could change later on
    5.  The parent directory is the folder that contains or hosts the files/directories within itself
